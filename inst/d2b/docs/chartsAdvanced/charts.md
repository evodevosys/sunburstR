# Charts

Advanced d2b charts provide additional properties supplied through the chart's input datum. All of the following examples use the `selection.call(chart.advanced)` methodology in order to enable the advanced properties.

The advanced charting options are only available on d2b `v > 1.0.0`. If using a previous version, refer to the [API docs](../api.md).

* [axis](axis.md) - axis chart for rendering line-graphs, bar-graphs, etc.. Each graph type can be used on it's own or mixed with each other.
* [pie](pie.md) - basic pie chart
